# Call_Sign_Parser_and_Lookup
Python 3 code to look up amateur radio (ham) call signs from the cty.dat file. 

This can be a standalone program (or used within another program) to parse a
callsign into a prefix, separator, and suffix and also determine the 
country from the prefix. 

This code needs to be made into a class so it can be added to another program
easily. I am sure there is a lot more to do with this code. It's messy, it's 
probably hillbilly backwards but it works. I'm learning to program so your
help is needed.

If you do use this in another project, or please fork it and add your enhancements
I'd love to see it or your project so I can learn more. 

I wrote this to be used eventually in my other project, FDLog_Enhanced.
